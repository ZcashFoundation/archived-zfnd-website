We are pleased to announce that [Josh Cincinnati](https://keybase.io/cin) has been hired as a part-time Senior Program Manager for the Zcash Foundation.
Josh is an active member in the cryptocurrency community, having been a Developer Advocate at BlockCypher, a company that specializes in APIs for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.
He is now a Developer Advocate at Lyft, a role he is holding concurrently while working for the Zcash Foundation part-time.

A more detailed list of duties for the Senior Program Manager can be found in the [GitHub Issue we opened.](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/10)
In a nutshell, the Senior Program Manager will accelerate the Foundation’s work to build a platform for the Zcash community—by coordinating communication across community members, organizing events and working groups, authoring and promoting public marketing, and more.
Josh strongly aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s [Mission](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/MISSION.md) and [Values](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/VALUES.md).
He is both grateful to learn from other cryptocurrencies’ contributions and apply them to help the Foundation grow.

The Foundation faces unique opportunities and challenges—ones that Josh is excited to take on as the Zcash Foundation’s first hire. We look forward to collaborating with him.
