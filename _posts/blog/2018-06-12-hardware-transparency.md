The Zcash community would benefit from greater transparency on the part of hardware manufacturers, as would the broader Equihash mining ecosystem. We are making a formal request for voluntary disclosures from Bitmain, Innosilicon, ASICminer, and any other company that makes mining hardware. We appreciate Bitmain’s [recent move](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/antiminer-z9-mini-shipments-experiment-radical-transparency/) in this direction, and hope to see more progress going forward.

Here are the disclosures that we’re asking for:

* The firm’s policy for when it does or does not mine with its own equipment
* A policy on which blockchains and which pools the firm will mine
* Transaction inclusion policy (for example, will the firm mine empty blocks)
* Hard data about self-mining, such as total hash rate, updated on a regular basis
* Shipping and volume info about Equihash-capable miners

Sharing this information is a way for hardware manufacturers to demonstrate good faith and build trust with the community.

**Edit 7/26/2018:** Bitmain has published a [transparency policy](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/transparency-policy-shipping-mining-practices/).
