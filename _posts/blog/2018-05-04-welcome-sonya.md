We are pleased to announce that [Sonya Mann](https://twitter.com/sonyaellenmann) has been hired as our full-time Communications Manager for the Zcash Foundation, and our third employee. 

Sonya comes to us from [Inc.](https://www.inc.com/), where she covered the business side of technology, with a focus on enterprise companies, the sharing economy, and marketplaces that empower informal entrepreneurship. She also did some fantastic freelance work—including one of my personal favorite articles onthe [cyberpunk aesthetic](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/10/27/the-cyberpunk-sensibility/). With her savvy media experience in tow, Sonya will be taking the lead on developing Zcash Foundation communication strategy and will handle our day-to-day comms—our [Twitter account is already 500% more active](https://twitter.com/ZcashFoundation). Sonya cares deeply about helping marginalized groups leverage privacy technology to protect themselves, and to that end, we're thrilled the Zcash Foundation [Mission](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/MISSION.md) aligns with her passion.

Please welcome me in joining [Sonya](https://twitter.com/sonyaellenmann) to the Foundation!
