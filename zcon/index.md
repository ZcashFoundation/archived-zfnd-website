## Privacy: From A to Zcon

**Why:** This inaugural event aims to encourage collaboration of privacy projects inside and beyond the Zcash ecosystem in a focused setting and to scale future events as the community grows.

**What:** A three day conference for people who are working on building the privacy infrastructure for the public good, broken into three tracks: (1) Zcash today, tomorrow and beyond; (2) Privacy tech in other cryptocurrencies and applications; (3) Community and governance. The full agenda can be found here: https://z.cash.foundation/zcon/schedule/

**Who:** Privacy researchers, practitioners, influencers, and members of the Zcash community

**Where:** Fairmont, The Queen Elizabeth Montreal, Canada

**When:** June 26, starting at 8:00am to June 28, ending at 2:30pm. We recommend traveling in on June 25 but there will not be any formal events on that day.

**Cost:** Full-ticket registration is 900USD, which includes entrance into the conference and most meals. Accommodations and travel are not included. We offer a special rate at the Fairmont of 349 CAD (~277 USD) a night.

**Financial aid:** Partial and full scholarships are available that could include registration accommodations and travel. We will evaluate candidates for scholarships on a case-by-case basis.

To avoid distractions, Zcon0 will be void of booths, product/ICO promotions, and sponsors.
